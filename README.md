Hello! My name is Bobby Tortorello and I am 19 yearrs old living in Mount Prospect, Illinois. In our community we have these Mini-Libraries that whole 
are made to hopefully bring kids to be able to get a better connection with books and litature all the same. The concept of the Mini-Libraries project is 
to have these Mini Libraries all around and you can just come up to one and if there is a book in there that you might want to read you can just take it,
if you have a book that you want to leave for a kid to be able to read go ahead. It's a community thing for kids to be able to get better access to books.

So now I'm going to talk about what the app is hopefully going to be able to do when I finish developing it. The concept of the app is to make the process
of the whole Mini Library experiance a lot easier. Within the app you can see all of the Mini Libraries that in use currently, you can see where they are 
located and you can see how far they are away from your current location. When you pick a specific library you can see a picture of it, it's address again
a little map showing exactly where it is, and the best feature of all, you can see what books are currently in there and this app is a community driven thing
so when you 'check out' a book you can just remove it from the list that is in that library. If you decide that you want to give one back to the library you
can just add it to the current list of books in there so anybody near by can see what book you just added. There are a bunch of features that I want to add
to this app but I am only a one man team and I'm 19 so I am also currently dealing with college.
